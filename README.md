# DiceRoller
This is an Android app with two main uses:

 1. This app let's you throw dices, outputting a random number.
 
 2. This app is helpful for oral tests:
    With this app you'll be able to choose students to test, giving a 3.2 % chance of getting picked to all students 
    (in a 30 students class)
    (Feature coming in the future)Also this app let's students choose when they will be tested (if teachers allow organized oral tests).
    
    
The app was programed and is mantained by David Wicker.
